      <h2>How to play</h2>
      <h3>Collecting:</h3>
      <p>
        Each new user gets a pack of 9 cards when they create an account. From then you can get 3 free cards, per day, by just scanning a QR-code.
        <br> Cards can also be upgraded to a higher rarity, this can be done by combining 3 of the same card, this will give you 1 card with a higher rarity.
      </p>
      <h3>Trading:</h3>
      <p>
        There's a trading system, made to interact with other students on the campus. You can trade cards, only if you're in the same GPS-location.
        <br> To start the trade, one player will be able to generate a QR-code that can be scanned by the other player. If both players confirm the trade, the cards will be transfered.
      </p>
      <h3>Battling:</h3>
      <p>
        Battles will be played in a 1v1 format, where each player can use 3 cards. The order in which the players start will be decided by a coin flip.
        <br> The player that wins the coin flip will start the battle and can perform one of the three options: attack (deals damage to the other player's active card), use ability (uses the ability of the active card) and switch (gives you the option to switch your active card with an inactive one). After that each player can perform 2 actions per turn.
        <br> If you can kill all the cards of your opponent, you win the battle and gain yourself the total amount of points of the cards you defeated. 
        <br> The loser also gets some points, they get the amount of points from the lowest rarity card of the opponent.

      </p>
      


      <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
      <p>
        The leaderboard will be split up into 3 different sections: group leaderboard, individual leaderboard and in the third section a QR-code for the daily login.

      </p>
      <h3>Individual leaderboard:</h3>
      <p>
        The individual leaderboard shows you the total amount of points scored by each individual user.
      </p>
      <h3>Daily login:</h3>
